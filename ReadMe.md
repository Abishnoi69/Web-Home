## Web-Home-Page

This is a simple web page that I created using HTML and CSS. It is a simple web page that contains a header, a navigation bar, a main content area, and a footer. The header contains the name of the website, the navigation bar contains links to other pages on the website, the main content area contains information about the website, and the footer contains contact information.

## Features
- Responsive sidebar with collapsible submenus
- Custom animations for menu items
- Dynamic theme switching
- Popper.js for tooltip-like behavior on collapsed sidebar
- Google Fonts and RemixIcon for typography and icons
